<i>(Song : Queen - Who wants to live forever)</i>
All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the
way that Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was
playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I
suppose she must have looked quite delightful, for her mother put her hand to her
head and cried “oh, why can’t you remain like this forever!” This was all that passed
between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she much grow up.
You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.

  <i>(Song: A Teens - Let the bells ring out for Christmas)</i>
Once upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge
sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal: and
he could hear the people in the court outside, go wheezing up and down, beating
their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement-stones to
warm them. The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already: it
had not been light all day: and candles were flaring in the windows of the
neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.

Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr Heathcliff’s dwelling. “Wuthering” became a
significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its
station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up
there at all times, indeed: one might guess the power of the north wind lowing over
the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by
a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the
sun.

<i>(Song : Carly Simon - You’re so Vain)</i>
As the painter looked at the comely and gracious form he had so skillfully mirrored in
his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger
there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed the fingers upon the
lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which
he feared he might wake.
“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done” Said Lord Henry
languidly.
